# New Constructions of Polar Code Based on Refined Error Probability Analysis

### 📡 IEEE GLOBECOM 2025 — Official Implementation

This repository contains the official implementation accompanying the paper:

> **Hassan Noghrei, Wai Ho Mow, and Murad Abdullah**
> *New Construction of Polar Code Based on Refined Error Probability Analysis*
> IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 2025

This project provides:

* A NumPy-based recursive Successive Cancellation (SC) decoder
* A decoder-aware block error rate (BLER) formulation
* A practical polar code construction algorithm optimized for SC decoding
* Monte Carlo simulation tools for BER/FER evaluation

The implementation bridges theoretical error analysis and practical SC decoder behavior, enabling decoder-aware polar code design.
